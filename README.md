# Scientific Method App

**Author:** Lily Watt

The goal of this project is to create an application that will help support the scientific method throughout the paper writing process. The app allows users to enter each step of the scientific method in a checklist format. Researchers mark those items as done and have reviewers then verify that each section of the report has been completed appropriately before the researchers move onto the next section.
